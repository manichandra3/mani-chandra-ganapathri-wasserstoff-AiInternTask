# Document Processing Application

## Problem Statement
Build a document processing application that allows users to:
- Upload and manage documents (PDF, images, text files)
- Search through documents using natural language queries
- Ask questions about document content and get AI-powered answers
- View and navigate through document content

## Solution Strategy

### 1. Architecture
- Frontend: React.js with modern UI components
- Backend: Python FastAPI for document processing and AI integration
- Database: PostgreSQL for document storage and metadata
- AI Integration: Hugging Face Transformers for document understanding

### 2. Key Features Implementation

#### Document Management
- Secure file upload with size and type validation
- Document metadata extraction and storage
- Efficient document retrieval and pagination
- Document deletion with proper cleanup

#### Search Functionality
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Keyword-based search for quick results
- Search result highlighting and context
- Pagination for large result sets

#### Q&A System
- Document context understanding
- Question answering using transformer models
- Source document referencing
- Answer confidence scoring

### 3. Technical Approach

#### Frontend
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- State management using React hooks
- Modal-based document viewing
- Real-time search and Q&A

#### Backend
- FastAPI for high-performance API
- Document processing pipeline
- AI model integration
- Database optimization
- Error handling and logging

### 4. Security Considerations
- File upload validation
- User authentication
- Data encryption
- API rate limiting
- Input sanitization

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of documents
- Caching of search results
- Efficient database queries
- Optimized file storage
- Response compression

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run the development server
5. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support
- Advanced document analytics
- Collaborative features
- Mobile application
- API documentation
